The primary goal of the Multi-Clap Sound Pattern Switch project is to design and 
build a touchless, sound-activated control system that can recognize different clap 
patterns and use them to control various electrical appliances. This system aims to 
offer a simple, efficient, and affordable solution for smart automation. 
• To develop a sound-based switching system capable of detecting single, double, 
and triple claps, allowing users to control multiple output devices independently. 
• To design a stable amplification circuit using the LM358 operational amplifier, 
ensuring that even weak signals from the microphone are amplified accurately for 
reliable detection. 
• To achieve a user-friendly, contactless automation setup that can be used in 
homes, classrooms, or assistive environments where touch-free control is 
beneficial.
